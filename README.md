Column-oriented DBMS
====================

Scripts for testing **MonetDB**, a *column-oriented DBMS*, against **MariaDB**,
using traditional *row-oriented* engines.

This work is part of an assignment for Datawarehouse Architectures teached at
the *School of Computer Sciences Engineering* of the *Technical University of
Madrid*.

This shouldn't be taken as a definitive test or benchmark due it's done for
showing where the column-oriented DBMS are usefull.

There isn't a definitive-killer-best-all-in-one DBMS, you need to know your data
and how is going to be used in order to decide wich DBMS fits best your scenario.
